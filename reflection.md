### The Journey so Far
1. What have you learned so far?
    I started this course with no coding knowledge.  So far I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Git, Handlebars, NPM Packages, Heroku and many other technologies.  Listing out all of the things I have learned is rather inspiring, especially since I now have an even longer list of new things I want to learn.
2. What have you accomplished?
    I have completed a few projects and a number of homeworks, but I don't feel like I have accomplished anything quite yet.  I probably won't feel like the job is complete until I graduate and maybe not until I get hired as a developer.
3. Think back to the first week, how have you changed and grown since then?
    The biggest change that I have noticed is my ability to read and understand code.  During the prework much of the code I was looking at was overwhelming and might as well have been Japanese.  Now, I can look at code and understand what is happening.  If there are lines in the code that I am not familiar with I have learned how to research and find out what the code is doing.

### Path to Success
1. What are your goals for the remainder of the course?
    My goal is to continue to learn and expand my range of skills.  At this point I feel my biggest weakness are databases.  I feel much more comfortable with the front end of coding.  That is certainly a goal of mine to improve my back end knowledge.  I also have a goal to complete an impressive final project and graduate with my certificate.
2. What do you hope to accomplish before the course completes?
    Really, my last big goal for this course is to complete a really impressive final project.  
3. What do you hope to accomplish after the course completes?
    After the course completes I ultimately want to get hired as a developer.  While applying for jobs I have my eye on a react specific course that will help me further develop those skills.  Ultimately, I think this will improve my ability to get hired as well.  I also have a few side projects that I would like to tackle as well.
4. What strategies will you employ to ensure you accomplish these goals?
    In order to achieve my employment and continue learning the skills necessary to be a great developer I will need to put in the time.  From everything I have heard about the hiring process it can be a full time job just to prepare for interviews.  As I have developed a coding habit my goal will be to keep that going and to apply, apply and apply.
5. How do these plans and goals differ from the first half of the course?
    I think the biggest difference between the first half and second half of the course it the difference between creating a habit and continuing a habit.
